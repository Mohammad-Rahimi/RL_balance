# RL_balance
Using PPO within Myosuite framework to predict the process of motor learning in human
created a new environment within myosuite framework to simulate perturbed balance training.
a platform moves underneath the musculoskeletal model and the PPO agent learns how to respond
to different levels of periodic perturbation imposed by the platform acting as a moving treadmill.
this project is still in progress
